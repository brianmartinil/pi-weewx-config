##############################################################################

#   This service acts as a filter, converting the unit system coming from
#   the hardware to a unit system in the database.

[StdConvert]

    # The target_unit affects only the unit system in the database. Once
    # chosen it cannot be changed without converting the entire database.
    # Modification of target_unit after starting weewx will result in
    # corrupt data - the database will contain a mix of US and METRIC data.
    #
    # The value of target_unit does not affect the unit system for
    # reporting - reports can display US, Metric, or any combination of units.
    #
    # In most cases, target_unit should be left as the default: US
    #
    # In particular, those migrating from a standard wview installation
    # should use US since that is what the wview database contains.

    # DO NOT MODIFY THIS VALUE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
    target_unit = US    # Options are 'US', 'METRICWX', or 'METRIC'

##############################################################################

#   This section can adjust data using calibration expressions.

[StdCalibrate]

    [[Corrections]]
        # For each type, an arbitrary calibration expression can be given.
        # It should be in the units defined in the StdConvert section.

        foo = foo + 0.2
